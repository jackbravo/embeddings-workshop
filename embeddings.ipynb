       " '### Introduction\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2018\\n\\n**_Caribbean governments need to proactively harness and adopt_**\\n**_artificial intelligence technology in public sector organizations to_**\\n**_create public value._**\\n\\nDespite its numerous benefits, public sector organizations in the\\nCaribbean are lagging in artificial intelligence[1] (AI) adoption. AI is\\na disruptive technology that has become increasingly ubiquitous\\nand pervasive in modern societies. Extremely transformative, they\\nhave advanced rapidly, and affect virtually every aspect of our\\nexistence, including the way we interact with and transact within\\nsociety. AI has provided many benefits, which were previously\\nunimaginable, and has had a significant impact across diverse\\ncontexts, including education, healthcare, financial services, the\\ndelivery of justice, and the defence sector, to name a few. Today,\\nmany governments worldwide are at the nascent stages of\\nintegrating AI into their operations to gain efficiency and realize\\ncost savings, improve the quality of services delivered to citizens,\\nand enhance policymaking capabilities[2]. The voluminous data that\\ncharacterizes government agencies provides an ideal environment\\nfor adopting AI to learn from and efficiently process these data to\\nresolve administrative problems in ways not previously possible.\\n\\n\\nKey recommendations\\n\\n- **Develop national AI strategies that**\\n**articulate the vision and policy framework**\\n**towards the adoption of AI, particularly**\\n**within the public sector.**\\n\\n- **Assess the current and potential**\\n**effectiveness of AI adoption in the public**\\n**sector on public value creation.**\\n\\n- **Embrace the public value management**\\n**paradigm within the context of public**\\n**sector reform.**\\n\\n- **Develop national AI capability to ensure**\\n**requisite human resources to drive all**\\n**aspects of AI adoption within the**\\n**public sector.**\\n\\n\\n\\n- **Integrate AI systems in the public sector**\\n**in a structural manner with a changing**\\n**mindsets approach to public administration.**\\n\\n\\n1 Given the continuing advances in technology, Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a system to identify, interpret, make inferences and learn from\\n\\ndata to achieve predetermined organizational and societal goals (Mikalef and Gupta, 2021).\\n\\n2 The objective of this Policy Brief is to foster interest and draw attention to the opportunities for AI adoption within the public sector to create public value. While AI',\n",
       " 'regulation is an important consideration, this issue is not directly addressed here.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nNotwithstanding the recent advances in AI, including\\nthe release of generative AI and the opportunities to\\nfoster AI innovation within public sector\\n\\norganizations, governments are challenged “to ensure\\nthat AI is adopted effectively for the public good”\\n(Hankins et al., 2023, p. 4). It remains to be seen what\\neffect AI will have on responsibilities and public\\nvalues upheld by governments.\\n\\nPublic value management has emerged as a leading\\npublic management paradigm in the post-traditional\\nbureaucracy and new public management (NPM)\\ngovernance models era. It is based on the democratic\\nprocess to explain the undergirding of public action\\nand to mitigate failures of the previous models in the\\npublic sector. In this regard, public value does not\\nonly focus on efficiency and goal achievement, but\\nalso emphasizes the fulfilment of societal\\n\\nexpectations and publicly-held values, including\\nequity, transparency, and responsiveness, by taking\\ninto consideration citizens’ preferences. Within the\\ncontext of public administration and policy, this\\nparadigm is critical for public sector administrators. In\\nparticular, public sector administrators strategically\\ncreate public value through a heightened emphasis on\\ndemocratic and collaborative governance and\\n\\ncitizenship to deliver quality public services (Moore,\\n1995; O’Flynn, 2007; Benington, 2009; Bojang,\\n2020). Thus, the government has a special role as\\nguarantor of public values, that is, going beyond\\nmerely being the supervisor and provider of services\\nto the public to value creation in the public sector.\\n\\nTherefore, in light of the growing emphasis for\\ngovernments to employ AI-enabled services, it is\\ncritical that the needs of citizens, as the primary\\nbeneficiaries of public services, remain paramount\\nwhile harnessing the potential of artificial\\n\\nintelligence. Within this context, if public sector\\norganizations are to fully harness the power of AI to\\ndeliver more efficient, inclusive and transparent\\nservices to citizens, it is important to clearly\\nunderstand the challenges of AI and avoid potential\\npitfalls by implementing appropriate mitigation\\nstrategies. To that end, this policy brief explores the\\ninterconnections between the deployment of artificial\\nintelligence within the public sector and public value\\ncreation, and proposes a framework for assessing the\\neffectiveness of AI adoption in the public sector and\\nits potential for public value creation.',\n",
       " '### Unlocking the potential value of artificial intelligence in the public sector\\n\\nWith the expansion of digital government, artificial\\nintelligence and the collection and analysis of big\\ndata are set to make the public sector organizations\\nleaner with increased levels of efficiency and\\nresponsiveness to the needs of citizens, all the while\\nstrengthening bureaucracy’s core purpose. With the\\nintroduction of AI-technologies in government\\npublic-sector ecosystems, traditional approaches to\\nservice provision, policymaking and enforcement\\ncan change rapidly. In addition, the public\\ngovernance implications for AI use in government\\ncan be varied. In this regard, the rise of AI use in\\ngovernment, together with the increased level of\\nsophistication of these applications has triggered\\nseveral public governance questions.\\n\\nTraditional approaches to service delivery have been\\nrapidly changing. Globally, AI has been used to\\nimprove the quality of services, foster the trust of\\ncitizens, as well as increase service delivery\\nefficiency and effectiveness. Altogether, proactive\\ngovernments have achieved greater levels of accurate\\nforecasting and enhanced levels of policymaking, as\\nvalue has been created in various functional areas,\\nincluding “decision support, transportation, public\\nhealth and law enforcement” (Zuiderwijk, et al., 2021).\\n\\nNotwithstanding, the use of AI within the public\\nsector can create some challenges and considerations\\nwhich must be addressed. At the core, it is critical\\nthat the adoption of AI in the public sector advances\\nthe public good. In this regard, to ensure citizens’\\nconfidence, the use of this technology must be\\ntransparent and predictable, such that the outcomes\\nare inclusive, fair, free of bias, and adhere to societal\\nconcerns for citizen privacy, safety, and trust.\\n\\nAdopting new technologies can be one of the main\\napproaches for transforming governments. However,\\npublic administrations, in today’s increasingly dataintensive environment, have at times failed to deliver\\nflagship policies that are reliant on information and\\ncommunications technologies (ICTs). New theories\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

Within\\nfour months of that release, GPT-4 was unveiled,\\nwhich exponentially expanded the processing\\ncapability of this system to enable it to exhibit humanlevel performance. In two months, the website had\\ngarnered over 100 million users, making it the fastestgrowing website in history (Wheeler, 2023).\\n\\nAt this pace, and with the introduction of new\\ntechnology players into the global AI race, existing\\nrules and legal guardrails can be woefully\\ninsufficient to deal with the velocity of AI\\ndevelopments. These guardrails, which were predicated\\non regulatory assumptions for expanding the\\nphysical power of humans, lack the focus and agility\\nto be meaningful for artificial intelligence and its\\naugmenting of cognitive power. This can have direct\\nconsequences for the regulatory considerations of\\nprivacy, competition, manipulation and misinformation,\\nparticularly given that the accuracy of AI models\\nincreases with the expansion of the data on which it\\nis trained. In this regard, traversing the regulatory\\ntightrope in the AI era between protecting public\\ninterest and promoting innovation and investment\\nrequires a multi-layered analysis for AI that\\ntakes cognizance of the varied use cases and\\ntheir accompanying applications, adoptions and\\ninherent risks.\\n\\nIn the hope of making government services more\\neffective and responsive, public sector agencies have\\nbegun to deploy AI applications that implement\\ngovernment policies.

Rather,\\nit highlights value creation and longer-term\\noutcomes of the public sphere.\\n\\nAt its core, it incorporates the dimensions of trust,\\nequity and legitimacy of public action into the notion\\nof public performance within the context of collective\\npreferences. In this regard, public value is not\\ndefined by the producers of the services and\\nproducts, but rather by the citizens who consume\\nthem. Public value management, therefore, represents\\n\\n\\na paradigm shift in the way public agencies manage\\nand deliver services to citizens.\\n\\nThis mode of management places value creation as\\nthe primary focus for public organizations, which has\\nnecessitated that public administrators model the\\norganization “by showing transversal processes that\\ncreate value for … different stakeholders … through\\nactivities and processes, outputs and outcomes”\\n(Amrani _et al., 2022, p. 363).

       " '### Artificial intelligence capability  and public value creation\\n\\nGiven the potential benefits for public value creation\\nand improved government operations, the adoption\\nof AI technologies in public administration has\\ngained increasing attention. However, one of the\\nfactors hindering progress is the lack of humanrelated AI capability within public organizations.\\nBoth technical and non-technical human skillsets are\\nrequired for the successful implementation of AI in\\nthe public sector. Mikalef et al. (2023) define AI\\ncapability as the innovation needed to uptake\\nartificial intelligence. The mere existence of AI\\nwithin a public administration does not necessarily\\ncreate public value. The ability to deploy AI\\nsolutions that improve quality and efficiency requires\\ninternal competencies which transcend the\\n\\nmotivation to use AI technologies. To derive value\\nfrom AI technologies, not only do AI systems have\\nto be successfully developed and deployed, they\\nmust also be integrated into the organization in a\\nstructural manner and with a changing mindsets\\napproach to public administration. AI competencies\\nare not only required of public administrators and\\nmanagers. Rather, every public servant must have\\nsome form of AI-related competencies, enabling\\nthem to find new ways of working with AI systems,\\nchanging traditional work procedures, as well as their\\nattitudes, to embrace new technologies to achieve\\nimproved outcomes.\\n\\nThe adoption of AI in the public sector is\\ntransformative and will affect the domestic labour\\nmarket and educational institutions with the need for\\nreskilling and upskilling of competencies to ensure\\ncontinued employability within an AI-enabled public\\nsector. In this regard, the current labour force would\\nneed to possess unique tools and capabilities to\\nsucceed in a future with AI. New skillsets are\\nrequired, particularly taking into consideration that\\nseveral jobs and occupations in the public sector will\\nbe at risk of being automated. In this regard, it would\\nbe critical for government to adopt the role of enabler,\\nproviding the requisite political commitment and\\nfunding to ensure that training institutions are able to',\n",
       " 'provide the necessary courses and vocational training.\\nThe adoption of AI in public administrations would\\nrequire professionals with an in-depth knowledge of\\nthe entire AI ecosystem, including development,\\ndeployment, and research and development. In this\\nregard, a core mission of the school system would\\nhave to be lifelong learning to ensure continuous\\nadaptation to the knowledge requirements of\\nemerging technologies.

AI is\\na disruptive technology that has become increasingly ubiquitous\\nand pervasive in modern societies. Extremely transformative, they\\nhave advanced rapidly, and affect virtually every aspect of our\\nexistence, including the way we interact with and transact within\\nsociety. AI has provided many benefits, which were previously\\nunimaginable, and has had a significant impact across diverse\\ncontexts, including education, healthcare, financial services, the\\ndelivery of justice, and the defence sector, to name a few. Today,\\nmany governments worldwide are at the nascent stages of\\nintegrating AI into their operations to gain efficiency and realize\\ncost savings, improve the quality of services delivered to citizens,\\nand enhance policymaking capabilities[2]. The voluminous data that\\ncharacterizes government agencies provides an ideal environment\\nfor adopting AI to learn from and efficiently process these data to\\nresolve administrative problems in ways not previously possible.\\n\\n\\nKey recommendations\\n\\n- **Develop national AI strategies that**\\n**articulate the vision and policy framework**\\n**towards the adoption of AI, particularly**\\n**within the public sector.**\\n\\n- **Assess the current and potential**\\n**effectiveness of AI adoption in the public**\\n**sector on public value creation.**\\n\\n- **Embrace the public value management**\\n**paradigm within the context of public**\\n**sector reform.**\\n\\n- **Develop national AI capability to ensure**\\n**requisite human resources to drive all**\\n**aspects of AI adoption within the**\\n**public sector.**',\n",
       " '- **Integrate AI systems in the public sector**\\n**in a structural manner with a changing**\\n**mindsets approach to public administration.**\\n\\n\\n1 Given the continuing advances in technology, Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a system to identify, interpret, make inferences and learn from\\n\\ndata to achieve predetermined organizational and societal goals (Mikalef and Gupta, 2021).\\n\\n2 The objective of this Policy Brief is to foster interest and draw attention to the opportunities for AI adoption within the public sector to create public value. While AI\\n\\nregulation is an important consideration, this issue is not directly addressed here.\\n\\n\\n1',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\nNotwithstanding the recent advances in AI, including\\nthe release of generative AI and the opportunities to\\nfoster AI innovation within public sector\\n\\norganizations, governments are challenged “to ensure\\nthat AI is adopted effectively for the public good”\\n(Hankins et al., 2023, p. 4). It remains to be seen what\\neffect AI will have on responsibilities and public\\nvalues upheld by governments.\\n\\nPublic value management has emerged as a leading\\npublic management paradigm in the post-traditional\\nbureaucracy and new public management (NPM)\\ngovernance models era. It is based on the democratic\\nprocess to explain the undergirding of public action\\nand to mitigate failures of the previous models in the\\npublic sector. In this regard, public value does not\\nonly focus on efficiency and goal achievement, but\\nalso emphasizes the fulfilment of societal\\n\\nexpectations and publicly-held values, including\\nequity, transparency, and responsiveness, by taking\\ninto consideration citizens’ preferences. Within the\\ncontext of public administration and policy, this\\nparadigm is critical for public sector administrators. In\\nparticular, public sector administrators strategically\\ncreate public value through a heightened emphasis on\\ndemocratic and collaborative governance and\\n\\ncitizenship to deliver quality public services (Moore,\\n1995; O’Flynn, 2007; Benington, 2009; Bojang,\\n2020). Thus, the government has a special role as\\nguarantor of public values, that is, going beyond\\nmerely being the supervisor and provider of services\\nto the public to value creation in the public sector.\\n\\nTherefore, in light of the growing emphasis for\\ngovernments to employ AI-enabled services, it is\\ncritical that the needs of citizens, as the primary\\nbeneficiaries of public services, remain paramount\\nwhile harnessing the potential of artificial\\n\\nintelligence. Within this context, if public sector\\norganizations are to fully harness the power of AI to\\ndeliver more efficient, inclusive and transparent\\nservices to citizens, it is important to clearly\\nunderstand the challenges of AI and avoid potential\\npitfalls by implementing appropriate mitigation\\nstrategies. To that end, this policy brief explores the\\ninterconnections between the deployment of artificial\\nintelligence within the public sector and public value\\ncreation, and proposes a framework for assessing the\\neffectiveness of AI adoption in the public sector and\\nits potential for public value creation.',\n",
       " '### Unlocking the potential value of artificial intelligence in the public sector\\n\\nWith the expansion of digital government, artificial\\nintelligence and the collection and analysis of big\\ndata are set to make the public sector organizations\\nleaner with increased levels of efficiency and\\nresponsiveness to the needs of citizens, all the while\\nstrengthening bureaucracy’s core purpose. With the\\nintroduction of AI-technologies in government\\npublic-sector ecosystems, traditional approaches to\\nservice provision, policymaking and enforcement\\ncan change rapidly. In addition, the public\\ngovernance implications for AI use in government\\ncan be varied. In this regard, the rise of AI use in\\ngovernment, together with the increased level of\\nsophistication of these applications has triggered\\nseveral public governance questions.\\n\\nTraditional approaches to service delivery have been\\nrapidly changing. Globally, AI has been used to\\nimprove the quality of services, foster the trust of\\ncitizens, as well as increase service delivery\\nefficiency and effectiveness. Altogether, proactive\\ngovernments have achieved greater levels of accurate\\nforecasting and enhanced levels of policymaking, as\\nvalue has been created in various functional areas,\\nincluding “decision support, transportation, public\\nhealth and law enforcement” (Zuiderwijk, et al., 2021).\\n\\nNotwithstanding, the use of AI within the public\\nsector can create some challenges and considerations\\nwhich must be addressed. At the core, it is critical\\nthat the adoption of AI in the public sector advances\\nthe public good. In this regard, to ensure citizens’\\nconfidence, the use of this technology must be\\ntransparent and predictable, such that the outcomes\\nare inclusive, fair, free of bias, and adhere to societal\\nconcerns for citizen privacy, safety, and trust.\\n\\nAdopting new technologies can be one of the main\\napproaches for transforming governments. However,\\npublic administrations, in today’s increasingly dataintensive environment, have at times failed to deliver\\nflagship policies that are reliant on information and\\ncommunications technologies (ICTs). New theories',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\nand conceptual frameworks are required to\\nunderstand and adopt the latest technology to realize\\nthe promise of fundamentally transforming government.\\nIn the case of AI, a critical challenge to its adoption\\nin the public sector is the need to ensure the\\nprotection of public interest, notwithstanding the\\nvelocity at which the system is evolving.\\n\\nThe November 2022 release of ChatGPT-3\\nrepresented a major tipping point in AI development,\\nwhich repositioned AI from being a tool for software\\ndevelopers, to a “consumer-focused” tool that everyone\\ncould use without needing technical expertise. Within\\nfour months of that release, GPT-4 was unveiled,\\nwhich exponentially expanded the processing\\ncapability of this system to enable it to exhibit humanlevel performance. In two months, the website had\\ngarnered over 100 million users, making it the fastestgrowing website in history (Wheeler, 2023).\\n\\nAt this pace, and with the introduction of new\\ntechnology players into the global AI race, existing\\nrules and legal guardrails can be woefully\\ninsufficient to deal with the velocity of AI\\ndevelopments. These guardrails, which were predicated\\non regulatory assumptions for expanding the\\nphysical power of humans, lack the focus and agility\\nto be meaningful for artificial intelligence and its\\naugmenting of cognitive power. This can have direct\\nconsequences for the regulatory considerations of\\nprivacy, competition, manipulation and misinformation,\\nparticularly given that the accuracy of AI models\\nincreases with the expansion of the data on which it\\nis trained. In this regard, traversing the regulatory\\ntightrope in the AI era between protecting public\\ninterest and promoting innovation and investment\\nrequires a multi-layered analysis for AI that\\ntakes cognizance of the varied use cases and\\ntheir accompanying applications, adoptions and\\ninherent risks.\\n\\nIn the hope of making government services more\\neffective and responsive, public sector agencies have\\nbegun to deploy AI applications that implement\\ngovernment policies. However, thanks to their selflearning and adaptive capabilities, AI systems have',\n",

The\\nadoption of these systems within public agencies\\nwould necessitate embedding operational procedures\\nthat articulate epistemic criteria that are aligned with\\nsocietal norms and concerns to mitigate humancentric rational thinking being substituted by an\\nalgorithmic reality that is intractable, impenetrable\\nand incontestable.\\n\\n### Artificial intelligence government readiness\\n\\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to transform\\nthe public sector by increasing institutional\\nproductivity and providing higher quality of services\\nto citizens.

One of\\nthe key indicators for this is the absence of national AI\\nstrategies. In October 2023, the Dominican Republic\\nbecame the first country in the subregion to release its\\nstrategy (Government of Dominican Republic, 2023).\\nOther countries are at various stages of articulating\\ntheir vision and national strategy for artificial\\nintelligence, with Oxford Insights reporting\\n\\nindications of forthcoming strategies from Cuba and\\nJamaica.

Except for Haiti,\\nwhich scored in the fifth quintile, all other countries\\nscored in the fourth quintile. Going forward, it would\\nbe critical for the governments of the subregion to be\\nproactive, if they are to harness the potential of AI.\\nA first step, in this regard, would be the articulation\\nof national AI strategies.\\n\\n### Public value creation\\n\\nAs a new way of thinking, the shift from New Public\\nManagement to public value management has\\nsignaled “a shift away from the logic of results and\\nefficiency to the broader governmental goal of\\ncreating public value” (Amrani et al., 2022, p. 360).\\nThe focus of public value management is on what is\\nvalued by the public and strengthening the public\\nsphere. It does not emphasize the short-term\\nactivities and outputs of previous paradigms.

However, one of the\\nfactors hindering progress is the lack of humanrelated AI capability within public organizations.\\nBoth technical and non-technical human skillsets are\\nrequired for the successful implementation of AI in\\nthe public sector. Mikalef et al. (2023) define AI\\ncapability as the innovation needed to uptake\\nartificial intelligence. The mere existence of AI\\nwithin a public administration does not necessarily\\ncreate public value. The ability to deploy AI\\nsolutions that improve quality and efficiency requires\\ninternal competencies which transcend the\\n\\nmotivation to use AI technologies. To derive value\\nfrom AI technologies, not only do AI systems have\\nto be successfully developed and deployed, they\\nmust also be integrated into the organization in a\\nstructural manner and with a changing mindsets\\napproach to public administration. AI competencies\\nare not only required of public administrators and\\nmanagers. Rather, every public servant must have\\nsome form of AI-related competencies, enabling\\nthem to find new ways of working with AI systems,\\nchanging traditional work procedures, as well as their\\nattitudes, to embrace new technologies to achieve\\nimproved outcomes.\\n\\nThe adoption of AI in the public sector is\\ntransformative and will affect the domestic labour\\nmarket and educational institutions with the need for\\nreskilling and upskilling of competencies to ensure\\ncontinued employability within an AI-enabled public\\nsector. In this regard, the current labour force would\\nneed to possess unique tools and capabilities to\\nsucceed in a future with AI. New skillsets are\\nrequired, particularly taking into consideration that\\nseveral jobs and occupations in the public sector will\\nbe at risk of being automated. In this regard, it would\\nbe critical for government to adopt the role of enabler,\\nproviding the requisite political commitment and\\nfunding to ensure that training institutions are able to',\n",

From the managerial\\nmodel, public administrators emphasize economic\\nand administrative logics of optimization to achieve\\nefficiency and productivity gains. As shown in\\ndiagram 2, in the case of the democratic and citizen\\nmodel, the emphasis is on ensuring that public\\nservices are delivered to address the needs of citizens,\\nincluding the need for ethical and transparent\\nresponsiveness, and accountability.
